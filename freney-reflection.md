    *What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    	*I was struggling with how to bring up Sublime through the commandline. Turns out, I don't have the right connection set up. Regina sent me a tutorial. I will also visit someone during office hours for help.
    *What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    	*During the GPS, we clarified what was wrong with my Sublime. We also talked about best practicies for git.
    *What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    	*I mostly asked questions about how to do things. I'm still new at this.
    *What still confuses you about Git?
    	*Why is it so picky????
    *How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    	*I'm not a particularly social or outgoing person. I always struggle with these types of experiences. Harini was a good partner, especially with Regina as a guide. I wished that the session itself was longer, due to me having to do other things. I chose to finish myself. Poor Harini was okay with it.
