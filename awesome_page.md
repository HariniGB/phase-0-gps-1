**My Hobbies are:**

1. Painting
2. Crafts
3. Cooking

*Painting*
---
>Painting is an art of playing with colors and textures. Since my childhood I have a great passion in painting which lead me to learn various types of painting like warli painting, tanjore painting, glass painting and metal embossing. Even when I’m not sketching designs in my laptop, I like to paint and do craft works. While in college, couple of my paintings were published in the college magazine. Another favorite hobby is to do craft works.

*Crafts*
---
>I like to make things out of nothing. My favorite website is DIY & Crafts. Since my childhood, my dream is to decorate my home interior with my art works. After moving to California, I started to decorate my interior house with eco-friendly paintings made by me. During this process, I was fascinated by the eco-friendly project ideas and their usage.

*Cooking*
---
>Cooking and Baking are fun!Baking is a wonderful way to spark a lifelong love of the kitchen in your children. I love to make muffins and cookies. In my life baking and cooking is like therapy that gives me relaxation and happiness. It's messy (and therefore fun!) and the results are hard to resist.
